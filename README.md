### About

I was inspired by [this](https://ciechanow.ski/exposing-nsmutablearray/) and [this](https://ciechanow.ski/exposing-nsdictionary/) article
to try implementing my own Swift Array from scratch. However, I took Deque implementation from the [Apple Collections library](https://github.com/apple/swift-collections/tree/main), which is more in tune with how Apple may have implemented Array in Swift.

### Important

This is a work in progress. I plan to write a data structure with the same API as Swift Array.
